# Weather for OSRS
Ambient weather effects for your Old School Runescape experience.

## Features
- Rain effects (configurable)
- Snow effects (configurable)
- Lightning effects (configurable)
- Sound effects for weather types (on/off)

### Flash Warning
Lightning when enabled delivers some punchy flashes, just like real life. 
Lightning is off by default for safety reasons.

## Brief
Dreamt up while afk fishing on Barbarian Village's riverbanks; this plugin will give you rain, thunder and snow. The Runescape from my childhood had weather, I'm sure of it. 

## Config
You can change most things; wind speed, thickness of droplets, dithering (falling sway), colour, speed of falling etc.

It *should* pause when you go inside.

## Future Plans
I'd like to create a location based system, but at a loss right now how to implement it. Advice welcome.

Right now everything is all manual, so remember to disable it when you go to the desert!
