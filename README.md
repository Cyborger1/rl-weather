# Weather for OSRS
Ambient weather effects for your Old School Runescape experience, making it more how you remember it.

## Features
- Rain effects (configurable)
- Snow effects (configurable)
- Lightning effects (configurable)
- Sound effects for weather types (on/off)

### Flash Warning
Lightning when enabled delivers some punchy flashes, just like real life. 
Lightning is off by default for safety reasons.

## Brief
Weather is something Runescape never had but you might still remember. 

Dreamt up while afk fishing on Barbarian Village's riverbanks; this plugin aims to make that memory reality.

I've tried to keep things old school, so if you want to contribute to the code; keep that in mind.

## Config
You can change most things; wind speed, thickness of droplets, dithering (falling sway), colour, speed of falling etc.

## Sound Credits
This plugin uses sounds generously provided by the creators on [FreeSound.org](https://freesound.org/).
